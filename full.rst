Summary
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm a Linux technologist and Free Software enthusiast.

I currently work at Intel as System Integration Engineer on behalf Celad.

On my free time, I hack open hardware and software projects like Yocto, 
Beaglebone or Arduino...
I'm very interested by new technologies, 3d printing, internet of things...
I contribute to open source projects in my previous positions and on my free 
time.

I also practice several sports: tennis, badminton, atv and hiking.
The next spring, I think follow the West Highland Way and the Cape Wrath Trail.

| *ONERA*
| *March 2011 – July 2011 (5 months), Toulouse Area, France*

**Project**: AGATA (Generic Architecture for Autonomy, agata.cnes.fr)

The joint program Autonomy (CNES-ONERA) is to conduct a proactive action 
technology designed to enable the implementation for future missions of 
autonomous systems complete with planning from the context. In this 
perspective, the joint program will be structured around Autonomy of achieving 
a complete simulator (segment board and control center) on the ground that 
will maximize the share of embedded intelligence for future missions. This 
simulator is designed with sufficient generality, will test configurations for 
missions or scenarios of use varied functions of self-integrated into a 
generic architecture.

**Role**:
  - Development of a tool to simulate the communication between different software 
    modules of heterogeneous critical systems.

Subsequently, the joint project on automonie exploration vehicles (CNES-ONERA), 
we want to simulate the communication between several autonomous vehicles whose 
flight software will be made using SCADE.

Finally, we wish to make hybrid simulations using the tool.

The tool is based on realized Robot Operating System (ROS), a middleware 
dedicated to robotics, deployable and heterogeneous distributed systems using 
several mechanical communication peer-to-peer between the different nodes of 
the system.

**Environment**:
  - *Tools:* Git / ROS (Robot Operating System)
  - *Tools software Environment:* GNU/Linux
  - *Langagues:* C / Python / Latex / XML / XSD / UML
